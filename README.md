[Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/) supports Ansible for managing devices running the Extensible Operating System (EOS) operating system natively through EOS API (eAPI) or [CloudVision Portal (CVP)](https://www.arista.com/en/products/eos/eos-cloudvision).
This collection includes a set of ansible roles and modules to help kick-start your automation with Arista. The various roles and templates provided are designed to be customized and extended to your needs!
